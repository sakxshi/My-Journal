# Why do you need MyJournal?

Everybody knows drinking ample amount of water is good for health but how often do you drink water? To make drinking water your habit, you need cues. You need to make it tempting. MyJournal does the same thing. Everybody knows journlaing is good for your mental health but how often do you practice that? To make it your habit, I have tried my best to make MyJournal very tempting. Anybody
struggling with inculcating this habit for a better mental health, MyJournal is here to help you. 

# What's coming up next?
