# Why do you need MyJournal?

Everyone knows that drinking enough water and journaling regularly are beneficial for health and well-being, but building these habits can be challenging. MyJournal is designed to make journaling more engaging and rewarding, helping users develop a consistent practice for better mental health. If you're struggling to build this habit, MyJournal is here to support you.
